# Usability Audit: Heuristic Evaluation of a Non-Profit Website

This project involved conducting a heuristic evaluation of the website for "It's Meow or Never," a local non-profit animal rescue organization, to identify usability issues and recommend improvements to better support their mission of facilitating adoptions and donations. Based on these findings, low-fidelity wireframes were created and then tested with a user to validate the proposed solutions.

## Objective

The primary goal was to systematically assess the website's user interface against established usability principles (heuristics) to uncover potential problems that might hinder users trying to adopt an animal, donate, or find information. A secondary goal was to translate audit findings into tangible solutions, creating and testing a low-fidelity prototype to better understand and empathize with user needs.

## Methodology

This project followed a three-phase rapid research process:

### Phase 1: Heuristic Evaluation
A heuristic evaluation was performed based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. I navigated key user flows and assessed page layouts, focusing on areas like navigation, content hierarchy, and calls to action.

#### Heuristics Applied
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

### Phase 2: Ideation & Prototyping
Based on the problems identified in the audit, I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. The goal was not a full redesign, but to propose solutions for the most critical usability issues, such as navigation clarity and content hierarchy. These screens were then connected into a simple, clickable prototype.

### Phase 3: Usability Testing
A moderated usability test was conducted with one user (a person familiar with the organization's mission) using the Figma prototype. The user was given key tasks to perform (e.g., "Find a cat to adopt," "Find how to donate") to see if the new designs were an improvement and to uncover any new usability issues.

## Heuristic Evaluation Findings

The evaluation identified several areas for usability improvement across the site:

* **Finding 1: Navigation Bar Complexity & Inconsistency** (Heuristic: #4 Consistency & Standards, #7 Flexibility & Efficiency)
    * *Description:* The main navigation structure is somewhat complex and could be streamlined. The logo placement interrupts the flow, the floating navigation bar is unconventional, and options like "Medical cases" (which is under "More") could function better as filters rather than separate top-level links. Other pages could be fit under options like "Resources" and "Services."
    * *Impact:* Makes it harder for users to quickly find what they need and understand the site structure.

        <figcaption className="text-sm text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 text-center mt-1 mb-4">Current navigation structure and logo placement.</figcaption>
    </figure>

* **Finding 2: Poor Contrast / Readability** (Heuristic: #8 Aesthetic & Minimalist Design, Accessibility)
    * *Description:* White text is used on red backgrounds (#e1533c) for navigation elements or buttons, resulting in poor contrast. For smaller text, the website fails to meet WCAG AA standards with a calculated contrast ratio of 3.81:1 (below the required 4.5:1).
    * *Impact:* Creates accessibility issues and strains users' eyes, potentially causing them to miss important information or actions.

        <figcaption className="text-sm text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 text-center mt-1 mb-4">Example of low contrast text (white on red background).</figcaption>
    </figure>

* **Finding 3: Ineffective Homepage Content Hierarchy & Layout** (Heuristic: #8 Aesthetic & Minimalist Design, #6 Recognition Rather Than Recall)
    * *Description:* The homepage layout could be optimized. Key information like the Mission Statement and Donate/Adopt calls-to-action could be more prominent. Features like the "Featured Cat" and "Community Partners" sections could be integrated more effectively (e.g., placing one featured cat higher up, using a looping marquee for partners). The standalone National Lost & Found database section could be placed under "Resources" to declutter the page. The statistics section could be presented more engagingly.
    * *Impact:* Users might miss key information or calls to action, and the page feels less focused.

        <figcaption className="text-sm text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 text-center mt-1 mb-4">Homepage sections lacking clear hierarchy.</figcaption>
    </figure>

* **Finding 4: Redundant Contact Information & Footer Deficiencies** (Heuristic: #4 Consistency & Standards)
    * *Description:* A large "Contact Us" section, including a form, appears in the footer area, potentially repeating on multiple pages instead of residing on a dedicated page. The footer is missing standard elements like a site map link. The "Gold transparency" element also lacks clear context.
    * *Impact:* Clutters pages and makes the footer less useful for site-wide navigation and information.

## Ideation & Prototyping

The findings from the heuristic audit directly informed the creation of low-fidelity wireframes in Figma, visualizing the prioritized recommendations with a focus on structure and flow.

* Streamlined Navigation: Implemented the proposed simplified navigation bar and created a dedicated "Contact" page concept.
* Re-prioritized Homepage: Restructured the homepage to elevate the Mission Statement and primary calls-to-action ("Adopt" and "Donate").
* Improved Readability: Corrected instances of low-contrast text in the concept.
* Enhanced Footer: Designed a standard footer with social links, copyright, and site map concept.

These wireframes were developed into a high-fidelity interactive prototype:

I wanted to quickly push out a prototype, so after completing my wireframes, I sent them to Figma Make to quickly generate a prototype for user testing. After some tweaking, I had a fully functional prototype [that you can view here](https://citron-debug-93707674.figma.site/).

## Usability Test

The clickable prototype was tested with one user to validate the proposed changes. Feedback was categorized into successes and areas for iteration.

### Successes (What Worked)
* **Improved Navigation:** The user successfully completed the task of "Find a cat to adopt" 5 seconds faster than a baseline test on the original site.
* **Clearer CTAs:** The user immediately identified the "Donate" button, stating, "Oh, it's much easier to tell what will happen when I click this button."
* **Better Readability:** The user did not report any issues with reading text, confirming the contrast fix.

### Areas for Iteration (What Still Needs Work)
* **"Resources" vs. "Services":** The user hesitated when asked to find the "Foster" program, looking under "Resources" before finding it under "Services." This indicates the labeling may still be unclear.
* **Featured Cat:** The user overlooked the "Featured Cat" section, suggesting it may still not be as prominent as intended.
* **Location:** The user gave the direct quote below. IMON should consider adding their upcoming events directly to their website.

## Prioritized Recommendations

The initial heuristic recommendations were validated and refined by the usability test. The final recommendations are:

1.  **High Priority: Improve Contrast:** Address low contrast issues (e.g., white text on `#e1533c`) to meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio). (Validated by usability test).
2.  **High Priority: Streamline Navigation:** Implement the proposed simplified structure: Home | Adoptable Cats | Resources | Services | Donate | About Us | Contact. Further test/clarify "Resources" vs. "Services" labels. Move logo and create a dedicated Contact page.
3.  **Medium Priority: Restructure Homepage:** Implement the new structure, but consider iterations to increase the prominence of the "Featured Cat" section. Integrate Community Partners dynamically (e.g., marquee). Consolidate L&F database link under Resources.
4.  **Medium Priority: Enhance Footer:** Implement a standard footer with site map, copyright, and social media links. Clarify or remove ambiguous elements like "Gold transparency".

## Conclusion

This heuristic evaluation and subsequent prototype testing provided actionable insights into usability weaknesses of the It's Meow or Never website. Addressing the prioritized recommendations related to navigation, contrast, content hierarchy, and standard web conventions would likely lead to a smoother experience for users, better supporting the organization's goals of facilitating adoptions and donations.
